# python-challenge
This challenege uses python to analyze two separate csv datasets: one for budgets for a company, and another for an election. For both, execute the analysis to print results to the terminal, as well as store a text file of the results in the corresponding Analysis folder. 

Note that in this challenge, I chose to use the pandas package throughout as it was easier to use and the code was more streamlined than the csv package.
